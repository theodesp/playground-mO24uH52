# Getting Started With Go!
Welcome to this tutorial on how to get started with Go. Go is a very popular application level programming language developed by Google, that has been used in major projects in the modern programming world. Projects like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [hugo](http://gohugo.io/), all leverage the power and simplicity of Go to build scalable platforms. 

It makes sense for a new programmer today to invest in learning Go and how it leverages new technologies.

Why should I learn Go?
===
* **It's really easy to learn**: Go favours simplicity, both in terms of syntax structures and programming conventions. Everything in the Go programming environment has been designed to minimize friction and make the experience smooth and pleasant - that is to say, no more long compilation times, no more dubious compiler errors, and no more strange things.
* **It's fast and reliable**: Go is a compiled programming language with built-in concurrency mechanisms that make it easy to  write programs that get the most out of multi-core and networked machines. It has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection.
* **It has a vast ecosystem**: Go has a large and growing community of enthusiasts. More than [762758](http://go-search.org/) packages and counting! The Go ecosystem covers a vast range of applications and use-cases. Because its design emphasizes simplicity and idiomatic code, reading and working with others' code has never been easier.
* **It's a growing language**: The more Go code that's deployed to production, the more need there is for solid and experienced Go developers. This is just a quick tutorial of Go to get you started.

What we will do in this tutorial:
===
* Explore the basics of Go.
* Learn more about Goroutines and why they are so awesome.
* Get more resources to continue learning and working with Go.
